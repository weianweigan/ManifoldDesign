A single hole cavity may be a drilled hole, a plug hole (SAE port, BSP port, NPT port, etc.), a cartridge valve cavity, a bolt hole, and a locating pin hole.

Angle holes with 0, 90, 180 or 270 α angles are called simple angle holes.
Angular holes with an angle other than 0, 90, 180, or 270 are called compound angular holes.

Beta angle (Beta) is the angle hole that is inclined to the surface normal.
The α and β angle values are entered in the Edit Hole Cavity dialog box.
